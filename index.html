					<h2>~ ABOUT ~</h2>

					<p>International Dance, LLC. was founded as the School of International Dance by Christina Heimlich
						in 1962. The school is directed by Elizabeth Hawkins. Assistant director Rebecca Collier and our
						instructors are Miss Elizabeth, Miss Becca, Miss Sarah, Miss Victoria, Miss Natalie, and Miss
						Misha.</p>

						They perform and carry on the traditions that uphold the standards of our founder.</p>

					<p>We want to take this opportunity to let you know a little more about our program. As a student,
						your child will learn about pre-ballet or ballet, creative movement as well as international
						folk and character dance. Some classes also study tap and jazz. Participation in our classes
						will encourage development of motor coordination skills, balance, partnering, flexibility,
						strength, concentration, independence, creativity through use of imagination, poise, posture,
						rhythm, discipline - all while having fun and learning about music and dance.</p>

						training stages intended to increase student's technical skills, stamina and discipline in
						accordance with their age and physical development. We work hard to emphasize correct placement
						in order to prevent injury. Our curriculum embraces traditional ballet principles and
						incorporates elements of the French, Italian and Russian training systems. These methods help to
						provide a healthy and enjoyable learning environment and allow the students to experience a
						feeling of mastery in each level. It is a style that readily adapts to meet the demands of any
						choreographer, any company, and any style of movement.</p>

						invited to participate in a higher level of training. Classes are not always dictated by age and
						do not coincide with academic grade levels or other dance school programs. We try to keep our

					<h2>~ HISTORY ~</h2>

					<p>Christina Heimlich was born in Gorlitz, Silesia, East Germany in 1918. As a young dancer Mrs.
						Heimlich (known as Christina Margarite Otto) began her career as a soloist ballerina with the
						Sadler Wells Ballet (now the English Royal Ballet). Mrs. Heimlich studied with Tatiana Gsosvska,
						Eutinia Eduardowa, and had master classes with Agrippinia Vaganova.</p>

					<p>At 16 years old she took the required license examination from Rudolf von Laban, the inventor of
						dance notation. Mrs. Heimlich was also an acclaimed European actress, choreographer, author and
						radio personality. In 1949 she was the Voice of Berlin for RIAS (Radio In the American Sector).
					</p>

					<p>In 1951 she met and married an American Col. William F. Heimlich, and followed him to the United
						States. In 1962 she founded her Academy of Ballet in Falls Church, Virginia, which she ran until
						her death in 2012.</p>

					<p>In cooperation with the German journalist Tamara Domentat, she wrote "Heimlich in the Cold War",
						which incorporates her late husband's unpublished memoirs. The book was published in 2000 by
						Autbau-Ferlag.</p>

					<p>In 1998 The Christina Heimlich Dancers were invited to go to Novgorod, Russia, by The Center of
						Culture and Leisure. Miss Lisa, one of our instructors Alisa Pappas, and 16 of the Christina
						Heimlich Dancers gave many performances including Russian Television. The dancers studied under
						Ludmilla Grigorieva-student of the great Igor Moiseyev. The Dancers felt right at home because
						of the training they received from Christina Heimlich, who brought European Folk and Character
						Dance to her American Students. </p>

					<p>Her dancers have performed at the White House, Kennedy Center, German, French, Turkish and
						Russian embassies, many American and Russian television programs and at the International
						Children's Festival at Wolftrap, where Mrs. Heimlich was one of the founders forty years ago.
					</p>

					<p>Today, former student Miss Elizabeth continues Mrs. Heimlich's festive yet disciplined
						traditional interpretations of Grimm's Fairy Tales as well as Chinese, Gypsy and Russian folk
						stories as well as tap, jazz and classical ballet. </p>

					<p>Classes are conducted in Annandale and Alexandria. Elizabeth Hawkins and her staff continue to
						teach children of all ages and adults this very special method that provides instruction of all
						levels, performance experience, and most of all a lifelong love and appreciation of the Dance.
					</p>

					<hr>

					<p>Lisa Filipy<br>
						~ Ballet Master/Consultant ~<br>
						Ballet Master Lisa Filipy was trained as an elite Christina Heimlich Dancer. She performed
						ballet, character, and folk dances for world leaders as well as countless others at The White
						House, The Kennedy Center, Wolf Trap and many other venues.</p>

					<p>She studied character and Russian dancing under Ludmilla Gregoreava (student of the great Igor
						Moiseyev), and received formal training with The Joffrey Ballet, Washington Ballet, Miami City
						Ballet and the Royal Canadian Ballet.</p>

					<p>Inspired by Christina Heimlich, Miss Lisa has carried on International Dance traditions for 45
						years and as its Former Artistic Director, she is best known for loving and inspiring
						generations of dancers and looks forward to inspiring many more.</p>

					<h2>~ POLICY ~</h2>

					<p>Here at International Dance, LLC. we desire to develop each student's love for dance, a strong
						technical foundation, the ability to perform as well as an artistic education. This policy is
						for your information and benefit. We request that you please read it thoroughly to avoid any
						possible misunderstandings in the future. Please retain it for your reference.</p>

					<h3>~ ENROLLMENT ~</h3>

					<p>Enrollment is for a continuous period each year from September through June (10 months).</p>

					<p>We encourage students to finish the year so as to complete the planned curriculum.</p>

					<p>In order to keep up with the level of the class, each student must maintain good attendance and
						be on time for the beginning of the class. This helps the student warm up properly and prevent
						injury.</p>

					<hr>

					<h3>~ PLACEMENT ~</h3>

					<p>Placement is at the discretion of the Directors and Instructors of International Dance, LLC. All
						students are carefully placed in levels to insure maximum progress. Although students are placed
						according to age for beginning levels, students with some training will be placed into
						respective classes depending on ability, strength and previous development based on the judgment
						of the directors and instructors.</p>

					<p>Advancement, however, depends upon application, attitude, artistic abilities, dance
						accomplishment and physical qualifications, not necessarily upon age, or length of time spent
						studying dance.</p>

					<hr>

					<h3>~ POINTE ~</h3>

					<p>Pointe (toe): Typically requires four or five years of preparatory study and is not permitted
						until a student is at least eleven, twelve or thirteen years old and has both good body
						placement and control. Exceptions to this and other pointe rules are determined by an assessment
						on an individual basis by the director.</p>

					<p>A minimum of two ballet classes a week is required to take pointe class because dancing on pointe
						shoes demands extra strength and technique. The dancers strength and focus contribute to ongoing
						progress on pointe.</p>

					<hr>

					<h3>~ TUITION ~</h3>

					<p>Tuition is to be paid IN ADVANCE whether paid in 1 complete annual payment or 10 payments
						covering
						September through June - according to the payment schedule. See Tuition for details.</p>

					<p>A withdrawal can only become effective when the studio is notified in writing 30 days in advance
						of
						a new four week period according to the payment schedule.</p>

					<p>If tuition is not current the student will not be allowed to continue classes.</p>

					<p>There is a $55 per student non-refundable registration fee for each year.</p>

					<p>There is a $20 cleaning fee per student.</p>

					<p>There is a $75 Media Technology fee per Family.</p>

					<p>A late fee of $25 will be assessed if payment is not made by the second week of the payment
						period.</p>

					<p>There will be a $35 charge for all returned checks.</p>

					<hr>

					<h3>~ ARRIVALS ~</h3>

					<p>Arrive 10 minutes before class begins (this ensures all dancers have adequate warm-up time to
						avoid
						injury).</p>

					<p>If a dancer arrives late please enter class but try not to disrupt the other dents.</p>

					<p>We strongly encourage parents to be on time for both dropping off and picking up your students.
					</p>

					<hr>

					<h3>~ MISSED CLASSES/ATTENDANCE ~</h3>

					<p>There is no refund or credit for missed classes for any reason, including injury or illness.</p>

						and be kind to each other at all times. International Dance does not tolerate bullying in any
						form; physical, emotional, social or otherwise.</p>

						or in person), that purposely and detrimentally targets another student, dancer, assistant,
						teacher, instructor, staff member and or parent/guardian.</p>

						members. This investigation may include but is not limited to contacting the alleged bullying
						party, the alleged victim, teachers, assistants, and parent/guardians who may have possibly
						witnessed the event(s). If staff investigation produces corroborating evidence of the report, it
						will be documented and serve as the basis for a course of action. International Dance director,
						Elizabeth Hawkins, also reviews any and all reports of bullying.</p>

					<p>Verified and documented reports may have severe consequences up to and including immediate
						termination of enrollment without refund for classes missed.</p>

						students. Parents or guardians who are witnessed as bullying or harassing another student,
